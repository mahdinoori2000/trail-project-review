        <p>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</p>
        <div>
          <ul id="tribute-list">
            <li><span>1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li>
              <span>1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
              University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known
              as the "National Youth Administration"
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money.
              Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
              Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this
              left scars on me."
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1937</span> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US
              Forestry Service
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1938</span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
              laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
              returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about
              breeding pest-resistent plants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1941</span> - Tries to enroll in the military after the
              Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked
              his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
              disinfectants, and other applied science.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
              Pathology
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
              leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new
              plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds
              6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including
              different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1945</span> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
              season, doubling wheat yields
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1953</span> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
              with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that
              responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's
              wheat.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1962</span> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
              strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help
              mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
            </li>

              increase their maize and sorghum yields
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1984</span> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M
